                <h2 class="about-title">Who We Are</h2>
                <p class="about-text">
                    We are a team of nine passionate Computer Science students from Helwan University, known as one of the best groups in our department. Driven by innovation, teamwork, and a shared love for technology, we constantly push ourselves to create meaningful projects that blend creativity with functionality.
                    <br><br>
                    ChayGPT was born as part of our IT project, where we set out to develop a fully functional website for a coffee shop. Our goal is to not only build an intuitive online ordering system but also showcase our skills in web development, design, and collaboration.
                    <br><br>
                    With each line of code and every design choice, we aim to deliver a seamless digital experience—proving that great ideas, strong teamwork, and a passion for tech can turn a simple project into something exceptional.
                    <br><br>
                    This is just the beginning, and we can't wait to see where our journey takes us next!

                <h2 class="about-title">How We Met</h2>
                <p class="about-text">
                    We are a group of nine friends brought together by our passion for coding, exploring all domains of computer science, and the many interests we have in common. That's what makes us the coolest group in Helwan—just like Hamza always says. We believe that each one of us brings something special to the team, complementing one another.
                    <br><br>
                    Each of us has a story about how we met the others. For example, Adam first met Hamza during the medical examination. Abdelrhman Tamer met Adam at the first math lecture when they arrived late. Adham met Saif two weeks after college started.
                    <br><br>
                    But if there was one person who unknowingly tied us all together, it was Hazem. He was the common factor in all our sections, introducing different people to each other, connecting the dots, and unintentionally forming the foundation of our team.
                    <br><br>
                    Little did we know that these chance meetings would lead to something bigger. As time passed, we realized that we weren't just classmates—we were a team. And when the time came to choose an IT project, the decision was clear: we would build something great together.
